dinkfiles, a Haskell library for reading and writing data files used by Dink Smallwood.

Currently has support for hard.dat, dink.dat and map.dat. The datatypes aren't stable yet,
particularly, there may be some arrays that can probably be changed to something else.
Writing structures back to a file is untested, but should work. Backup just in case.
